# Internal Data Collection and LLM Fine-tuning

This project aims to collect data from various internal systems, process the collected data, and store it in Amazon DynamoDB. The processed data is then used to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance and adapt it to the specific domain and requirements of the organization.

## Overview

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Collection**: Scripts and tools are developed to extract relevant data from internal systems, such as databases, log files, and APIs. The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and normalized to ensure consistency and compatibility.

2. **Data Processing**: The collected data undergoes further processing to prepare it for storage and fine-tuning. This may include tasks such as data deduplication, anonymization, and feature extraction. The processed data is structured in a format suitable for ingestion by the LLM.

3. **Data Storage**: The processed data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, a highly scalable and flexible NoSQL database. DynamoDB provides fast and reliable access to the data, allowing efficient retrieval during the fine-tuning process.

4. **LLM Fine-tuning**: The stored data is used to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM. The fine-tuning process involves training the LLM on the organization-specific data, enabling it to capture the nuances, terminology, and patterns specific to the internal systems and processes.

5. **Performance Monitoring and Evaluation**: After fine-tuning the LLM, the model's performance is rigorously monitored and evaluated using a series of predefined metrics. This ensures that the LLM meets the organization's requirements in terms of accuracy, relevance, and response quality. Continuous evaluation helps in identifying areas where further improvements or additional fine-tuning may be necessary.

6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: The entire process, from data collection to LLM fine-tuning and deployment, is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that updates and improvements can be made seamlessly as new data becomes available. The automated pipeline allows for quick iterations, enabling the organization to keep the LLM up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
